Q1: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   someone's else work than the idea of remote repository works pretty fine.
=============
Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
    automatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?
A: [Manual Pulling]:

    1. Very flexible for the personnel working on a project and needs more
       control to where the content must be pulled and to which repo or directory
       locally.
    2. Personnel pulling content can adhere to "One commit per logical change".

    [Auto Pulling]:

    1. Auto pulling although sometimes good, often lacks more control to the
       content being pulled by anyone.
    2. Often it pulls several commits(say an entire branch) which might lead to
       conflicts.

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
    use one instead of another?

Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
branch?
A: Following are the benefits:
    1. A copy is form of backup of your work, so if the state of the original is
       changed at original, the changes can be reverted back.
    2. The work remains updated rather than out-of-sync.
    3. If the changes made at remote by someone is undesirable than those changes
       can be managed and resolved via the copy at origin/master or vice-versa.
