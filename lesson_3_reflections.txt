Q1: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: Remote repositories are by definition exist as repository created remotely, thus if someone wants to share his/her work or contribute to some
   someone's else work than the idea of remote repository works pretty fine.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
    automatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?
A: [Manual Pulling]:

    1. Very flexible for the personnel working on a project and needs more
       control to where the content must be pulled and to which repo or directory
       locally.
    2. Personnel pulling content can adhere to "One commit per logical change".

    [Auto Pulling]:

    1. Auto pulling although sometimes good, often lacks more control to the
       content being pulled by anyone.
    2. Often it pulls several commits(say an entire branch) which might lead to
       conflicts.
