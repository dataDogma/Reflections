Reflect: Initializing a Repository

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Initializing a repo does 2 things:

    1. Git creates a hidden directory ".git" which contains meta info for
       helping git to track those file, view logs, commit changes etc.

    2. Git is able to track your files, which later wasn't the case!


Q: Why do you need to do it?
A: For git to track the files, it need a staging area where it could, hence
   we do it.
